This project has been created to recall and learn good practices with React.

The different subprojects are being created with Vite. Using SWC the transpilation speed is better than it was in my previous projects with Babel/Webpack (creat-react-app).

Tips to take advantage of this repo:

1. go into the projects following the order set in their prefix name
2. read their individual README to see what is going on there
3. run the project with `npm run dev` and see the little magic happening on your browser

Most of the things that I am explaining and coding here are inspired by the hiperuseful tutorial of Midudev. Follow it at

You won't regret it... unless you do not understand spanish :sweat_smile:
